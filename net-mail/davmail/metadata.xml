    DavMail POP/IMAP/SMTP/Caldav/Carddav/LDAP Exchange Gateway
    Ever wanted to get rid of Outlook ? DavMail is a POP/IMAP/SMTP/Caldav/Carddav/LDAP exchange
    gateway allowing users to use any mail/calendar client (e.g. Thunderbird with Lightning or
    Apple iCal) with an Exchange server, even from the internet or behind a firewall through
    Outlook Web Access.
    DavMail now includes an LDAP gateway to Exchange global address book and user personal
    contacts to allow recipient address completion in mail compose window and full calendar
    support with attendees free/busy display.
    The main goal of DavMail is to provide standard compliant protocols in front of proprietary
    Exchange. This means LDAP for global address book, SMTP to send messages, IMAP to browse
    messages on the server in any folder, POP to retrieve inbox messages only, Caldav for
    calendar support and Carddav for personal contacts sync.
    Thus any standard compliant client can be used with Microsoft Exchange.
    DavMail gateway is implemented in java and should run on any platform. Releases are tested
    on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac OSX. Tested successfully with the Iphone
    (gateway running on a server).
