	mmccopy utility is an easier-to-use alternative to dd for writing images to SDCards and MMC memory. It has the following features:
    Write image data from stdin or a file directly to an offset on the device (this is similar to dd except that offsets are specified in bytes instead of blocks)
    Batch up writes into 1 MiB blocks by default to improve transfer rate. (dd defaults to 512 byte blocks without the bs argument)
    Automatically unmount partitions that are using the device. This prevents data corruption either due to latent writes from the mounted file systems or due to image writes being cached.
    Provide human and machine readable progress similar to using pv with dd, except with the improvement that the percentages track completed writes rather than initiated writes.
    Automatic detection of MMC and SDCards. This option queries the user before writing anything by default to avoid accidental overwrites.
	Optionally run a TRIM command on the MMC or SDCard before writing to it. This lets you quickly reset the entire memory contents even if you're only going to write a fraction of it. This is only available on devices and SDCard readers that support the TRIM command.
